# Firefly III - Personal Finance Manager (Docker Swarm)
# https://www.firefly-iii.org/
#
# This stack file sets up Firefly III with PostgreSQL database,
# data importer, and automated cron jobs for Docker Swarm deployment.
# Uses local bind mounts for persistent storage (configurable via Portainer).
#
# Before deploying, create the following secrets in Docker Swarm:
# docker secret create fireflyiii_site_owner <file>
# docker secret create fireflyiii_app_key <file>
# docker secret create fireflyiii_db_password <file>
# docker secret create fireflyiii_postgres_password <file>
# docker secret create fireflyiii_mail_password <file>
# docker secret create fireflyiii_cron_token <file>
# docker secret create fireflyiii_importer_mail_password <file>
#
# IMPORTANT: Create the local directories before deployment:
# mkdir -p /mnt/cephfs/firefly-uploads /mnt/cephfs/firefly-db
# chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/cephfs/firefly-uploads
# chown -R 999:999 /mnt/cephfs/firefly-db
#
# Or create environment variables in Portainer Swarm stack deployment:
# - SITE_OWNER: Your email address for system notifications
# - APP_KEY: 32-character encryption key (generate with: openssl rand -hex 16)
# - DB_DATABASE: Database name
# - DB_USERNAME: Database username
# - DB_PASSWORD: Database password
# - POSTGRES_DB: Same as DB_DATABASE
# - POSTGRES_USER: Same as DB_USERNAME
# - POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Same as DB_PASSWORD
# - MAIL_FROM: Email address for outgoing mail
# - MAIL_USERNAME: SMTP username
# - MAIL_PASSWORD: SMTP password
# - MAIL_HOST: SMTP host (e.g., smtp.gmail.com, smtp.outlook.com)
# - STATIC_CRON_TOKEN: 32-character token for cron jobs
# - APP_URL: Public URL of your Firefly III instance
# - IMPORTER_MAIL_DESTINATION: Email destination for importer reports
# - IMPORTER_MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: Email sender address for importer
# - IMPORTER_MAIL_HOST: SMTP host for importer
# - IMPORTER_MAIL_PORT: SMTP port for importer
# - IMPORTER_MAIL_USERNAME: SMTP username for importer
# - IMPORTER_MAIL_PASSWORD: SMTP password for importer
# - IMPORTER_MAIL_ENCRYPTION: SMTP encryption for importer
# - FIREFLY_UPLOAD_PATH: Local path for Firefly III uploads (e.g., /mnt/cephfs/firefly-uploads)
# - FIREFLY_DB_PATH: Local path for PostgreSQL data (e.g., /mnt/cephfs/firefly-db)
#
# Note: Set FIREFLY_UPLOAD_PATH and FIREFLY_DB_PATH in Portainer to configure
# where data will be stored on the host system.
#
# Deploy with: docker stack deploy -c fireflyiii-swarm.yaml fireflyiii
